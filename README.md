# TensorFlow Implementation of Categorical VAE

## References
- This repository is forked from [@vithursant/VAE-Gumbel-Softmax](https://github.com/vithursant/VAE-Gumbel-Softmax).
    - I think the original code was wrong since `tf.nn.softmax` was applied across wrong dimension.

## MNIST example
| Ground Truths	| Reconstructions 	| Generations    |

- NOTE THAT the reconstructions were generated by using ground truths as inputs. 
- I also added generations, where the latent variables are sampled from uniform priors.
